# EthosLens: AI Governance Agent Platform

## Project Overview

EthosLens is a full-stack AI governance platform that provides real-time compliance monitoring, violation detection, and policy enforcement for AI systems. It transforms traditional AI interactions into governance-aware conversations through an intelligent agent architecture that combines CopilotKit's agentic UI with LlamaIndex-powered reasoning and Neo4j graph-based audit trails.

**Core Flow:**
1. User interacts with AI through CopilotKit interface
2. Prompts are processed by OpenAI/LlamaIndex backend
3. EthosLens governance agents analyze responses for violations (PII, bias, misinformation)
4. System blocks, flags, or approves content based on policy enforcement
5. All interactions and violations are stored in Neo4j for compliance tracking
6. AI assistant provides governance insights and trend analysis

**Theme Alignment:** Addresses the critical need for AI safety and compliance in enterprise environments, providing real-time governance that goes beyond post-hoc auditing to active policy enforcement.

## Quick Demo/Run Steps

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure Node.js 18+ and npm are installed
node --version  # Should be 18+
npm --version
```

### Setup & Run
```bash
# 1. Clone and install dependencies
cd govguard
npm install

# 2. Configure environment (already set up)
# .env file contains all necessary API keys and Neo4j credentials

# 3. Run full-stack application
npm run dev:full
# Backend: http://localhost:4000
# Frontend: http://localhost:5174

# 4. Test the application
# - Navigate to Live Monitor
# - Click "AI Assistant" 
# - Try violation examples:
#   * "My SSN is 123-45-6789" (PII)
#   * "All women are bad at math" (Bias)
#   * "COVID is fake news" (Misinformation)
```

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/health
# Should return service status and configuration
```

## Reproducibility & Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
# Run backend only
